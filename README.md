# Schedule-Dat-Life

WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

Used a moment-formatted jquery to apply current day/time to ID

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

Used bootstrap to make 13 rows (one for each hour 8am to 8pm) and applied pre-given css as well

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

Made an if/else function applying colors based off given time frame

WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event

Used a bootstrap function for inputting text

WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

Made a click function sending text/time to local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

Made a function gettting text/time sent to local storage in previous function and keeping in designated time
